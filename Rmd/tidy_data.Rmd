## Tidy data

<img src="assets/img/tidy_data.png" height="500">


## Principles of tidy data 

### tidy data structure

  - **One variable per column**.
  - **One row per observation**.

### **why?**

<p class="accent_border"><b>Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise</b></p>

> While one can do the exact same analyses with tidy and messy datasets/tools, the tidy approach will generally require much less code, and hence be faster to write, easier to debug, and easier to modify/maintain.

<p class="round_border">Best to record data in tidy format but <code>tidyR</code> package provides functions to tidy untidy data</p>


## Install tidyR {.smaller}

```{r, message=F}
#install.packages("tidyr", "dplyr")

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

```

-if you are asked about storing to a personal library just type 'y' (yes)

## Examples of messy data {.smaller}

- Column headers are values, not variable names.

- Multiple variables are stored in one column.

- Variables are stored in both rows and columns.

- Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same row.

<p class="accent_border"><b>Most messy datasets can be tidied with a small set of tools:</b></p> 

### **gathering**, **separating** and **spreading**. 

## 1 - wide data {.smaller}
### one variable over many columns

In this experiment three (rather unusually named) people were given two different drugs (a and b) and their heart rate was recorded:

```{r}

messy <- data.frame(
  name = c("Wilbur", "Petunia", "Gregory"),
  a = c(67, 80, 64),
  b = c(56, 90, 50)
)
head(messy)

```

**How many variables have we got?**


## 1 - wide data  {.smaller}
 
In this experiment three (rather unusually named) people were given two different drugs (a and b) and their heart rate was recorded:

```{r, background="blue"}

messy <- data.frame(
  name = c("Wilbur", "Petunia", "Gregory"),
  a = c(67, 80, 64),
  b = c(56, 90, 50)
)
head(messy)

```

**How many variables have we got?**

**A sensible model we might want to fit:**

```heart rate ~ drug```


How can we supply the data to a modelling function? (e.g. ```lm()```)


## 1 - wide data {.smaller}

We use the function ```gather()``` in the tidy package to reshape the dataframe from wide to long format


```gather(data, key, value, ..., na.rm = FALSE, convert = FALSE)```

- ```data``` :       **a data frame**
- ```key``` :   **name for the identifier of the columns to gather** 
- ```value```:  **name for the new variable being created**
- ```...```:  **select the columns to be stacked**
    + <small>you can use ```:``` to select all variables between two columns.</small> 
    + <small>use bare variable names (ie " " not required).</small>

```{r}

tidy  <- gather(data = messy, key = drug, value = heartrate, a:b)



```

## 1 - wide data {.smaller}

```{r}
tidy
```

```heart rate ~ drug```

## 2 - clumped data  {.smaller}
### more than one variable in a single column

In this study, parasite counts were made on samples taken from 3 elephant faecal boluses and two locations 


```{r}

messy <- data.frame(
  id = rep(1:2, each = 6),
  spl.id = paste(rep(rep(1:3, each = 2),2), c("centre", "outer"), sep = "-"),
  counts = rnbinom(12, mu = 2, size = 15)
)
head(messy, 8)
```



## 2 - clumped data {.smaller}
### more than one variable in a single column

We use ```separate()``` to split ```spl.id``` into ```bolus``` and ```location```, using a regular expression to describe the character that separates them.

```separate(data, col, into, sep , remove = TRUE, convert = FALSE, extra = "error", ...)```

- ```data``` :         **a data frame**
- ```col``` :   **name of column to split** 
- ```into``` :   **name for the new variable being created** (as character vector)
- ```sep```:  character as regular expression to match to any **non-alphanumeric** values
    + numeric indicates position of split
    + **length of ```sep``` should be one less than length of ```into```**



## 2 - clumped data  {.smaller}
### more than one variable in a single column

```{r}

separate(data = messy, into = c("bolus", "location"), col = spl.id, sep= "\\-")

```


## 3 - Combination of messy data {.smaller}

In this study, the time people spent on their phones was measured at two locations (work and home) and at two time points.

```{r}

messy <- data.frame(
  id = 1:4,
  trt = sample(rep(c('control', 'treatment'), each = 2)),
  work.T1 = runif(4),
  home.T1 = runif(4),
  work.T2 = runif(4),
  home.T2 = runif(4)
)
head(messy, 8)
```



## 3 - Combination of messy data {.smaller}

First we first use ```gather()``` to turn columns ```work.T1```, ```home.T1```, ```work.T2``` and ```home.T2``` into a key-value pair of key and time. (Only the first eight rows are shown to save space.)

```{r}

tidier <- gather(data = messy, key = key, value = time, -id, -trt)
head(tidier, 8)
```

## 3 - Combination of messy data {.smaller}

Next we use ```separate()``` to split the key into ```location``` and ```time```, using a regular expression to describe the character that separates them.


```{r}

tidy <- separate(data = tidier, col = key, into = c("location", "timepoint"), sep = "\\.") 

head(tidy, 8)

```
